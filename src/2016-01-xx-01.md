> 2016 受朋友邀请，在家翻译 Let Her Go，过于注重押韵，有些乱翻，笑笑就好

Well, you only need the light when it's burning low
当你需要灯光照亮时，火焰将熄

Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
当你想念阳光普照时，夜雪初霁

Only know you love her when you let her go
当你发觉你还爱她时，放手停息

Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
不经低谷怎知生之可贵

Only hate the road when you're missing home
不作异客怎知家之可贵

Only know you love her when you let her go
不曾放手怎知她之可贵

And you let her go
但你已放手

Staring at the bottom of your glass
你看着空荡荡的杯底

Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
希望有一天美梦延续

But dreams come slow, and they go so fast
但梦境确实走来飞去

You see her when you close your eyes
当你闭上双眼，她的身影浮现

Maybe one day, you'll understand why
或许也有一天，你领悟这体验

Everything you touch surely dies
一切都将逝去，根本无需试验

Chorus...

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
看着天花板消逝于虚无

Same old empty feeling in your heart
同样的空虚让你变麻木

'Cause love comes slow, and it goes so fast
爱情来得慢却从不停驻

Well, you see her when you fall asleep
你入睡，她出现

But never to touch and never to keep
梦太脆，梦太短

'Cause you loved her too much, and you dived too deep
爱太深，爱太多

Chorus...
