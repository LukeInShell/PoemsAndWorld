> 写于上海闵行龙茗路

Haven't composed for a long time
So I start to walk in Shanghai
And try to hack out some rhyme
All of a sudden
I smell my dream heaven

Smell the powder of infanter
Smell the fragance of younger
Smell the sandalwood of elder
Smell the freshness of grass by the river
Smell my heart shed a tear

Time knelled, my heaven fell
Now I can just smell
Though I also want to dwell
I have to say farewell
With my face wearing smile
